	abstract = {The utilization of insect protein in poultry feed is globally gaining momentum. However, the nutritional quality of meat from hen fed diet with black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) as fishmeal (FM) substitute has received limited research attention. Our results revealed that feed substitution did not affect the proximate compositions of the meat products. Omega 3 fatty acids were uninfluenced (P {\textless} 0.05) whilst the total monounsaturated fatty acids progressively increased with increasing dietary inclusion of BSFLM. Lysine, methionine, and isoleucine were significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in insect-fed hen meat products. The levels of zinc and B vitamins except B1 were proportionally enhanced in the chicken fed BSFLM incorporated diet. Thus, up to 75 \% replacement of FM with BSFLM did not significantly compromise the meat quality. Meat from hen fed diet with BSFLM could be considered as promising and novel ingredient in the manufacturing of nutritious food products with healthy appeal for consumers.},
